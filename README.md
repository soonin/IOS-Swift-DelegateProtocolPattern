# IOS-Swift-DelegateProtocolPattern
``` Level : Intermediate ```

This tutorial we learn how to use Delegate and Protocol to pass data. Delegates are a design pattern that allows one object to send messages to another object when a specific event happens. Imagine an object A calls an object B to perform an action. Once the action is complete, object A should know that B has completed the task and take necessary action, this can be achieved with the help of delegates! This tutorial is made with Xcode 10 and built for iOS 12.
